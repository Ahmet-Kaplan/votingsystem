# voting system access control application
The application is being developed and tested with [Wildfly 8.2.0.Final](http://wildfly.org/downloads/)

### Configure static resources handler
To serve the backups generated by the application the server must have configured a file handler and a location with undertow subsystem, 
for that in standalone.xml:

    <server name="default-server">
        <http-listener name="default" socket-binding="http"/>
        <host name="default-host" alias="localhost">
            <location name="/" handler="welcome-content"/>
            <location name="/AccessControl/static" handler="accessControlStatic"/>
        </host>
    </server>
    <handlers>
        <file name="welcome-content" path="${jboss.home.dir}/welcome-content" directory-listing="true"/>
        <file name="accessControlStatic" path="/var/local/voting_system/access_control" directory-listing="true"/>
    </handlers>

The value of the variables 'vs.staticResourcesURL' and 'vs.staticResourcesPath' must be set according to the values configured
in the file standalone.xml.
